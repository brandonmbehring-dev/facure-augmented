    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Engaged users only\" is a **Conditional on Positives (COP)** analysis that introduces selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem**:\n",
    "1. Treatment affects WHO becomes \"engaged\" (selection into sample)\n",
    "2. Treatment and control \"engaged\" groups are NOT comparable\n",
    "3. The composition of engaged users differs by treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: A push notification might engage users who otherwise wouldn't engage. Among engaged users:\n",
    "- Treatment: Mix of naturally-engaged + notification-activated users\n",
    "- Control: Only naturally-engaged users\n",
    "\n",
    "If notification-activated users behave differently (less engaged baseline), the COP analysis is biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct approach**: Analyze ALL users, including non-engaged (with zeros or appropriate outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: A coupon increases purchases by 20% but COP analysis shows -15% effect on basket size. How do you explain this to stakeholders?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation framework**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The coupon WORKS**: 20% more customers are purchasing (extensive margin)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **COP is misleading**: The -15% on basket size among buyers is because:\n",
    "   - Coupon attracts **new, price-sensitive buyers**\n",
    "   - These buyers have smaller basket sizes than regular buyers\n",
    "   - The composition of \"buyers\" changed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The right metric is total revenue**:\n",
    "   - More customers buying (even if smaller baskets) can increase total revenue\n",
    "   - Show the math: If purchase rate goes from 10% to 12%, and average basket goes from $100 to $85:\n",
    "     - Control: 0.10 × $100 = $10 per customer\n",
    "     - Treatment: 0.12 × $85 = $10.20 per customer\n",
    "     - Still a +2% lift!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analogy**: \"A discount airline has lower customer satisfaction ratings than a luxury airline, but serves 10× more customers profitably.\"\n",
    "\n",
