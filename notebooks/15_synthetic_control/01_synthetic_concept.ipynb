    "> **Interview Relevance**: Synthetic control has been called \"the most important innovation in policy evaluation in recent years.\" It's a go-to method when you have one treated unit and aggregated data. Understanding the intuition and limitations is essential.\n",

    "### 1.1 The Problem with Aggregated Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In many policy evaluations, we only have **aggregated unit-level data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- State-level cigarette sales (not individual purchases)\n",
    "- Country-level GDP (not firm-level output)\n",
    "- City-level crime rates (not individual crimes)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with traditional DiD**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small sample size**: With 2 states × 2 periods = 4 observations, we can't do inference\n",
    "2. **No perfect control**: The control state may differ systematically from the treated state\n",
    "3. **Single-unit treatment**: Often only one unit is treated (California, Germany, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Creating a Synthetic Counterfactual\n",

    "**The synthetic control method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find weights that make the weighted combination of control units look like the treated unit *before* treatment\n",
    "2. Apply those weights to project what the treated unit *would have looked like* after treatment\n",
    "3. The gap is the treatment effect\n",
