    "\n",
    "Facure's example: **Education → Investments ← Wage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Education and Wage are **independent** causes of Investments\n",
    "- Investments is a **collider**\n",
    "- If we condition on Investments, we CREATE a spurious link between Education and Wage\n",
    "\n",
    "**The trap**: It seems sensible to \"control for\" investment behavior when studying education → wage. But this introduces bias!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Explaining Away\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition**: Among people with the same investment level:\n",
    "- If someone has high education but low investments, their wage must be LOW (to explain the investment level)\n",
    "- If someone has low education but high investments, their wage must be HIGH\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **negative** spurious correlation between education and wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────\n",
    "- Colliders are **closed** by default (no bias)\n",
    "- Conditioning on colliders **opens** them (creates bias)\n",
    "- Selection bias can often be \"fixed\" by doing nothing\n",
    "- We are biased toward action—avoid the temptation!\n",
