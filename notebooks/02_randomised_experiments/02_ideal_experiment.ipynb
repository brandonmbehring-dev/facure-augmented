    "> **Interview Relevance**: Articulating the \"ideal experiment\" demonstrates causal thinking. It's the mental model for understanding natural experiments and quasi-experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 When RCTs Aren't Possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure identifies three barriers to RCTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Unethical**\n",
    "- Can't randomize smoking during pregnancy to study birth weight\n",
    "- Can't randomize violence exposure to study trauma\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Expensive**\n",
    "- Randomizing credit lines costs money (defaults on inflated lines)\n",
    "- Large-scale policy experiments require government resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Infeasible**\n",
    "- Can't randomize countries to different minimum wages\n",
    "- Can't randomize historical events\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Ideal Experiment Thought Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure's advice: **Always ask: \"What is the perfect experiment I would run if I could?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This clarifies:\n",
    "1. What treatment you're actually studying\n",
    "2. What population you care about\n",
    "3. What confounders might exist\n",
    "4. What observational strategy might approximate the ideal\n",
    "\n",
    "★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────\n",
    "- The ideal experiment is a thought tool, not a requirement\n",

    "**Key insight**: Causal inference requires understanding (or controlling) the assignment mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Known vs Unknown Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**When mechanism is known**:\n",
    "- RCT: Mechanism is designed (coin flip)\n",
    "- Regression discontinuity: Mechanism is rule-based (cutoff)\n",
    "- Natural experiment: Mechanism exploits policy variation\n",

    "**Facure's point**: The assignment mechanism cannot be discovered from data alone—it requires domain knowledge."

    "   - Selection on observables → Regression, matching\n",
    "   - Selection on unobservables → IV, RDD, DiD needed\n",

    "3. **Cannot be discovered from data**:\n",
    "   - Same data can have multiple explanations\n",
    "   - Need domain knowledge or experimental design\n",
