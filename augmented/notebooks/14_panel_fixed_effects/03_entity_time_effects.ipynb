    "1. **Common shocks exist**: All units affected by macro trends\n",
    "   - Economic cycles, policy changes, seasonality\n",

    "2. **Treatment timing correlates with time**:\n",
    "   - If more units get treated later, and outcomes also trend up, time FE removes this confound\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Theory suggests period-specific effects**:\n",
    "   - Inflation, technology shifts, regulation changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't include when**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Very few time periods**: Estimating T-1 time dummies with small T loses power\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Treatment is time-invariant**: If no one's treatment changes over time, you can't separately identify treatment and entity effects anyway\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You want to estimate time trends**: Time FE absorbs the effect of time, so you can't estimate it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical test**: F-test for joint significance of time dummies:\n",
