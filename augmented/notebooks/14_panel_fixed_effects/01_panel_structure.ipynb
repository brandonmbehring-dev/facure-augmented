    "**Mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross-sectional: Can only control for *measured* confounders via regression/matching\n",
    "   - If beauty affects both marriage and wages, and we can't measure beauty, we have bias\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Panel: By tracking the *same person* over time, time-invariant characteristics are held constant\n",
    "   - Person 1 at age 30 vs Person 1 at age 35: beauty is the same\n",
    "   - Any change in wages must be due to something that *changed* (like marriage)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal**: The fixed effect $\\alpha_i$ absorbs all time-invariant heterogeneity:\n",
    "$$Y_{it} = \\beta T_{it} + \\alpha_i + \\epsilon_{it}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate $\\beta$ using only *within-person* variation, so unmeasured but fixed confounders like ability, beauty, and intelligence don't bias the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- Cannot control for time-*varying* unmeasured confounders\n",
    "- Requires sufficient within-unit variation in treatment\n",
