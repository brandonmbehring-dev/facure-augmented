    "> **Interview Relevance**: RDD is considered the \"gold standard\" among quasi-experimental methods. Understanding when it provides credible causal inference—and its limitations—is essential for senior DS/Econ roles.\n",

    "### 1.1 Artificial Jumps in Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure's poetic observation: **Nature is smooth. When we see jumps, they're probably man-made.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of artificial discontinuities:\n",
    "- Age thresholds: Drinking age (21), voting age (18), retirement (65)\n",
    "- Test score cutoffs: College admission, graduation requirements\n",
    "- Income thresholds: Tax brackets, welfare eligibility\n",
    "- Geographic boundaries: School districts, electoral boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "These artificial jumps create **natural experiments**: people just above and just below the threshold are essentially comparable, but one group receives treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Is Alcohol Killing You?\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure's example: **The Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) and mortality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US, the legal drinking age is 21. This creates a sharp discontinuity:\n",
    "- Just under 21: Cannot legally drink\n",
    "- Just over 21: Can legally drink\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: At exactly 21, what determines whether someone is barely under or barely over? Birth date—essentially random. This provides a \"local randomized experiment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────\n",
    "- RDD exploits discontinuities in treatment assignment\n",
    "- Near the cutoff, treatment is \"as-if\" randomly assigned\n",

    "\n",
    "The probability of treatment jumps from 0 to 1 at the cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumption (Continuity)**: The conditional expectation functions $E[Y_0|R=r]$ and $E[Y_1|R=r]$ are continuous at $r = c$.\n",

    "   - Hard to manipulate or cherry-pick results\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fewer assumptions than DiD**:\n",
    "   - DiD requires parallel trends (often contentious)\n",
    "   - RDD requires continuity at ONE point (usually more credible)\n",

    "**Prefer DiD when**:\n",
