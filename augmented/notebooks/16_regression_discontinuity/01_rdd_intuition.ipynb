    "> **Interview Relevance**: RDD is considered the \"gold standard\" among quasi-experimental methods. Understanding when it provides credible causal inference—and its limitations—is essential for senior DS/Econ roles.\n",

    "### 1.1 Artificial Jumps in Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure's poetic observation: **Nature is smooth. When we see jumps, they're probably man-made.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of artificial discontinuities:\n",
    "- Age thresholds: Drinking age (21), voting age (18), retirement (65)\n",
    "- Test score cutoffs: College admission, graduation requirements\n",
    "- Income thresholds: Tax brackets, welfare eligibility\n",
    "- Geographic boundaries: School districts, electoral boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "These artificial jumps create **natural experiments**: people just above and just below the threshold are essentially comparable, but one group receives treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Is Alcohol Killing You?\n",
    "\n",
    "Facure's example: **The Minimum Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) and mortality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the US, the legal drinking age is 21. This creates a sharp discontinuity:\n",
    "- Just under 21: Cannot legally drink\n",
    "- Just over 21: Can legally drink\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: At exactly 21, what determines whether someone is barely under or barely over? Birth date—essentially random. This provides a \"local randomized experiment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────\n",
    "- RDD exploits discontinuities in treatment assignment\n",
    "- Near the cutoff, treatment is \"as-if\" randomly assigned\n",

    "\n",
    "The probability of treatment jumps from 0 to 1 at the cutoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumption (Continuity)**: The conditional expectation functions $E[Y_0|R=r]$ and $E[Y_1|R=r]$ are continuous at $r = c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{r \\to c^-} E[Y_0|R=r] = \\lim_{r \\to c^+} E[Y_0|R=r]$$\n",

When would you prefer it to DiD?\"*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**RDD Strengths**:\n\n1. **Local randomization**: Near the cutoff, treatment is \"as-if\" randomly assigned\n   - What determines if you're barely 21 or barely under? Birth date = random\n   - Continuity assumption is often very plausible\n\n2. **Transparent**: The \"RDD picture\" is visually compelling\n   - Stakeholders can see the jump without understanding statistics\n   - Hard to manipulate or cherry-pick results\n\n3. **Fewer assumptions than DiD**:\n   - DiD requires parallel trends (often contentious)\n   - RDD requires continuity at ONE point (usually more credible)\n\n**Prefer RDD over DiD when**:\n- Treatment is assigned by a threshold rule\n- You have good running variable data\n- Parallel trends assumption is questionable\n- You only need LATE at the cutoff\n\n**Prefer DiD when**:\n- No natural threshold exists\n- Treatment affects entire groups over time\n- You want ATE, not just LATE at cutoff\n- Pre-treatment data is available to test assumptions\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Q2 (Google L5, Quant)**: *\"What is the continuity assumption in RDD? How could it be violated?\"*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**Continuity Assumption**:\n\n$$\\lim_{r \\to c^-} E[Y_0|R=r] = \\lim_{r \\to c^+} E[Y_0|R=r]$$\n\nIn words: Potential outcomes are smooth through the cutoff. There's no other discontinuity at exactly $c$.\n\n**Violations**:\n\n1. **Manipulation/sorting**:\n   - Students retake tests to get above cutoff\n   - Income manipulation for welfare eligibility\n   - **Test**: McCrary density test for bunching\n\n2. **Compound treatments**:\n   - Multiple things change at the cutoff\n   - At age 21: Can drink AND do other things legally\n   - At income threshold: Lose benefits AND face different tax rate\n\n3. **Covariate discontinuities**:\n   - Other characteristics jump at the cutoff\n   - **Test**: Balance tests on pre-treatment covariates\n\n4. **Anticipation effects**:\n   - Behavior changes just before/after cutoff in anticipation\n   - College seniors drink more right before turning 21\n\n**Diagnostic checklist**:\n- McCrary test (density manipulation)\n- Covariate balance at cutoff\n- Placebo cutoffs (effect at non-cutoff points?)\n- Donut hole RDD (exclude observations right at cutoff)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Q3 (Amazon L6, Econ)**: *\"Why is the RDD estimate a 'local' effect? What are the implications for external validity?\"*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**RDD is local in two senses**:\n\n1. **Local in running variable**:\n   - Effect identified only at cutoff $R = c$\n   - MLDA study: Effect at exactly age 21\n   - Cannot extrapolate to age 18 or 25\n\n2. **Local in population** (Fuzzy RDD):\n   - Effect only for compliers\n   - People who change treatment due to cutoff\n   - Not for always-takers or never-takers\n\n**External validity implications**:\n\n1. **Policy relevance depends on cutoff**:\n   - Effect at 21 may differ from effect at 18 or 25\n   - Risk tolerance, peer effects, etc. vary by age\n\n2. **Cannot aggregate to population ATE**:\n   - Without additional assumptions, stuck with LATE\n   - May be sufficient for policy if policy IS the cutoff\n\n3. **Heterogeneous effects problematic**:\n   - If treatment effects vary with running variable\n   - Cutoff effect may not generalize\n\n**When local = good enough**:\n- Policy question IS about the cutoff\n- \"Should we change the drinking age from 21?\"\n- Effect at 21 is exactly what we need\n\n**When local is insufficient**:\n- \"Should countries with 18 change to 21?\"\n- Effect at 21 in US may not transfer to 18→21 change\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Q4 (Stripe L5, DS)**: *\"RDD requires continuity at the cutoff. Does this mean treatment is 'as good as random'? What's the distinction?\"*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**Trick question alert**: \"As good as random\" is an oversimplification.\n\n**What continuity actually means**:\n- Potential outcomes $E[Y_0|R]$ and $E[Y_1|R]$ are smooth at cutoff\n- No OTHER discontinuity at the threshold\n- NOT the same as random assignment\n\n**Key distinction**:\n\n1. **Random assignment** (RCT):\n   - Treatment independent of ALL variables\n   - $T \\perp (Y_0, Y_1, X)$\n   - Global balance on observables and unobservables\n\n2. **Local randomization** (RDD):\n   - Treatment appears random NEAR the cutoff\n   - Continuity of conditional expectations suffices\n   - Only requires smoothness, not independence\n\n**Practical implications**:\n\n- RCT: Can use simple difference-in-means\n- RDD: Need to model relationship with running variable\n- RDD: Bandwidth choice matters (bias-variance tradeoff)\n- RDD: Only local effect identified\n\n**When the distinction matters**:\n\n- With discrete running variable: Local randomization interpretation more appropriate\n- With continuous running variable: Continuity-based identification\n- Policy extrapolation: RDD doesn't support moving cutoff arbitrarily\n\n**One-liner**: \"RDD isn't random assignment—it's exploiting continuity. Near the cutoff, treatment is quasi-random, not truly random.\"\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Q5 (Netflix L6, Econ)**: *\"You have both RDD and DiD options for the same research question. How do you choose between them?\"*\n\n<details>\n<summary>Solution</summary>\n\n**Decision framework**:\n\n| Criterion | Favors RDD | Favors DiD |\n|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| Assumption credibility | Continuity easy to defend | Parallel trends defensible |\n| Data requirements | Dense data near cutoff | Long pre-treatment panel |\n| Effect generalizability | Only need local effect | Want broader ATE |\n| Treatment variation | Threshold-based | Time/group variation |\n| Manipulation concern | Low sorting risk | N/A (different concern) |\n\n**Practical decision tree**:\n\n1. **Is there a credible threshold?**\n   - Yes → RDD is a candidate\n   - No → DiD or other methods\n\n2. **Can you test parallel trends?**\n   - Multiple pre-periods available → DiD stronger\n   - No pre-data → RDD may be better\n\n3. **What effect do you need?**\n   - Effect at threshold (policy-relevant) → RDD\n   - Average effect across population → DiD\n\n4. **Data density near cutoff?**\n   - Sparse → DiD may be more precise\n   - Dense → RDD feasible\n\n**Ideally, do BOTH**:\n- If estimates agree → stronger evidence\n- If they disagree → investigate why (different estimands? Assumption violation?)\n\n**Example**: Minimum wage effects\n- RDD: Compare firms just above/below employee threshold\n- DiD: Compare states that raised minimum wage vs. those that didn't\n- Both valid, answer slightly different questions\n\n**One-liner**: \"RDD wins on assumption credibility; DiD wins on generalizability. If both apply, do both and triangulate.\"\n\n</details>"
