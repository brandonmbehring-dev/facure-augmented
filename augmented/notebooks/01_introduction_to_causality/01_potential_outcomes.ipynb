    "\n",
    "> **Interview Relevance**: The potential outcomes framework (Rubin Causal Model) is the lingua franca of causal inference. Every tech company expects candidates to articulate causal questions using this notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Why Bother with Causality?\n",
    "\n",
    "As Facure eloquently puts it, Machine Learning excels at *prediction* but struggles with *counterfactual* questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction**: \"Given these features, what's the likely outcome?\"\n",
    "- **Causal**: \"What would happen *if* we changed this feature?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal question requires understanding **what would have happened** under a different intervention\u2014the road not taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, / And sorry I could not travel both...\"*  \n",
    "> \u2014 Robert Frost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of causal questions**:\n",
    "- Does giving tablets to students improve test scores?\n",
    "- Does a college degree cause higher earnings?\n",
    "- Does the new UI increase conversions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Fundamental Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **fundamental problem of causal inference**[^1] is that we can never observe the same unit with *and* without treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student $i$ either gets a tablet or doesn't\n",
    "- We see their score under *one* condition\n",
    "- The counterfactual outcome remains forever unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a statistical problem\u2014it's a logical impossibility. No amount of data can reveal what *would have been*.\n",

    "<summary>Solution</summary>\n",

    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition**: We can never observe both potential outcomes $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ for the same unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why it matters**: The individual treatment effect $\\tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$ requires both outcomes, so it's fundamentally unknowable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not a data problem**: Even with infinite data, we can't see what *would have happened* to a specific individual under the alternative treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resolution strategy**: \n",
    "   - Estimate *average* effects by comparing groups\n",
    "   - Use randomization to make groups comparable\n",
    "   - Use statistical adjustments when randomization isn't possible\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Example**: \"If I took aspirin and my headache went away, did the aspirin help? I can't know for certain\u2014maybe the headache would have gone away on its own.\"\n",

    "- **ATT** = $E[Y_1 - Y_0 | T=1]$: Average effect among those who *actually* received treatment\n",

    "**When they differ**:\n",
    "- **Heterogeneous treatment effects**: If treatment affects some people more than others\n",
    "- **Selection into treatment**: If people who benefit most are more likely to take treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use ATE**:\n",
    "- Policy targeting: \"If we mandated this for everyone, what would happen?\"\n",
    "- Universal programs: Education, public health interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use ATT**:\n",

    "<summary>Solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The temptation**: Train ML model on treated outcomes, predict what control would have been (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it fails**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No ground truth**: We never observe the counterfactual, so we can't validate predictions. ML needs labeled examples to learn from\u2014but the \"labels\" (counterfactual outcomes) don't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selection bias**: If treatment assignment depends on unobserved factors that also affect outcomes, predictions will be biased. ML can only extrapolate patterns in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution shift**: Predicting treated outcomes for control units requires extrapolating outside the training distribution\u2014notoriously unreliable for ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When ML CAN help**:\n",
    "- **CATE estimation**: With proper causal assumptions (e.g., unconfoundedness), ML can estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (see Causal Forests, Meta-learners)\n",
    "- **Nuisance parameter estimation**: In Double ML, ML predicts confounders to debias treatment effect estimates\n",
