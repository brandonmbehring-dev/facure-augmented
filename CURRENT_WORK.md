## Right Now
Initial repository setup - validating all notebooks execute correctly.

## Why
Establishing independent educational materials for causal inference study.

## Next Step
Run full test suite: `pytest augmented/tests/ -v`

## Context When I Return
- 102 augmented notebooks covering chapters 1-25 + appendices A1-A5
- 30 original Facure notebooks for reference
- 21 datasets in `augmented/data/facure/`
- Tests validate notebook execution

## Recent Changes
- Extracted from causal_inference_mastery to independent repo
- Renamed package from `facure_augment` to `augmented`
- Updated all imports in 102 notebooks
- Configured .claude/ with lever_of_archimedes hooks
- Set up research-kb MCP server connection
